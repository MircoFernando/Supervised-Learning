# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project focuses on predicting passenger survival on the Titanic dataset using **supervised machine learning models**.  
The main objective is to compare and contrast **from-scratch implementations** (Decision Tree, Bagging) with **library-based models** (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Bagging, Boosting), and evaluate their performance using standard metrics.

## üìå Project Overview
- **Dataset**: Titanic Survival Dataset (passenger information including demographics and ticket details).  
- **Objective**: Predict whether a passenger survived (`1`) or not (`0`).  
- **Methods Implemented**:
  - Logistic Regression (No Penalty, L1, L2)  
  - Decision Tree (Shallow vs Deep)  
  - Ensemble Methods (Bagging & Boosting)  
  - From-scratch implementations of Decision Trees and Bagging  
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Accuracy  
  - Precision  
  - Recall  
  - F1 Score  
  - ROC-AUC  

The project demonstrates the importance of **regularisation, ensemble learning, and feature preprocessing** in improving classification performance.
